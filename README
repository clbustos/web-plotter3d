web-plotter 3D
==============

A very simple web-based 3d plotter, using jQuery, Silvester and canvas.
This is a proof-of-concept made on a couple of hours to learn to draw on canvas, but could be easily wrapped as a jQuery plugin or something like that.

Demo: [http://web-plotter3d.apsique.com]

How to use
==========

Just clone the git and open the file plotter3d.html on your browser. That's all.
On the main textarea you could insert point coordinates, using commas to separate the X,Y and Z values.
The textarea at the right is the ortographic projection. You could change the
values to distort the figure
The a slider rotates the figure on vertical plane. The b slider rotates the figure on the horizontal plane. The s slider changes the scale.
You could also rotate the figure using the mouse over the canvas.

Have fun!
